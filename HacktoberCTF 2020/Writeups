'DEADFACE is a notorious hacker group made up of largely of hacktivists that target businesses, government, universities, and individuals. While they're active year-round, they always increase their activity in October with the intent to wreak havoc and cause mayhem. They have no particular political or idealogical affiliation - they simply enjoy hacking whether it's breaking systems or stealing data.'

This Capture the flag event had an imaginary hacker group called 'DEADFACE'. All of the challenges were based around this group.
